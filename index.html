	<h2> Benefits of Honey</h2>
		<div class="section3content">
			<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Rich in Antioxidants</h4>
			<p>Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar 
			substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. 
			But specific honey varietals known as "active" honeys have also been 
			utilized throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties.
			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Natural Cough Medicine</h4>
			<p>
			Honey is a time-honored remedy for a sore throat. According to one study,
			it can also relieve coughs more effectively than OTC medications that contain dextromethorphan(DM),
			a cough suppressant. You can create your own remedy at home by mixing up to 2 teaspoons of
			honey with herbal tea or warm water and lemon.

			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Lowers Blood Pressure</h4>
			<p>
			Blood pressure is an important risk factor for heart disease, and honey may help lower it. 
			This is because it contains antioxidant compounds that have been linked to lower blood pressure.
			Studies in both rats and humans have shown modest reductions in blood pressure from consuming honey.
			</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="section3content">
					<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Improves Cholesterol</h4>
			<p>
			Studies have shown that consuming honey lowers LDL (bad)cholesterol by 6-11% and lowers triglyceride
			levels by as much as 11%. Honey may also increase HDL(good)cholesterol by about 3%.
			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Improves Heart Health</h4>
			<p>
		    It's high in antioxidants, such as phenolicacids and flavonoids, which may support better health.
			Small studies in humans show honey's antioxidants could help improve cholesterol levels,
			which could help decrease the risk for heart disease although larger long-term studies are 
			needed to confirm those findings

			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="section3element">
			<h4>Antibacterial properties</h4>
			<p>
			Honey contains hydrogen peroxide,which may account for some of its antibacterial properties.
			It also has a high sugar content,which can help stop the growth of certain bacteria. 
			Additionally, honey has a low pH level.This works to pull moisture away from bacteria, 
			causing the bacteria to get dehydrated and die off.

			I have been a big user of honey for years now for several reasons, health being number 1. And over 
			the years I have tried numerous brand of honey and I was always satisfied with the quality of them, until I '
			tried fvlTA Honey Valley. The quality of Honey Valley's honey is second to none. Ever since I tried the first 
			bottle I have not used another brand since and I have absolutely no intention of using any. 
			The productquality is exceptional and the customer service from the fvlTA Honey valley team is top notch. 
			Honey Valley,You Guys are the best!!!
